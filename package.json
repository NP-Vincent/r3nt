  "description": "The **Clean-Slate** rebuild of r3nt replaces the legacy split between booking, deposits and SQMU tokenisation with a single, modular suite of Solidity contracts. The goal is to deliver a unified booking flow for Farcaster Mini App users while keeping deposits transparent, rent streams scalable and investor tokenisation optional on every stay. All value transfers are settled in canonical **USDC (6 decimals)** and every upgradeable module relies on the OpenZeppelin UUPS pattern.",
